         Course Description
         This course covers modern computer architecture, including branch prediction, out-of-order instruction execution, cache
         optimizations, multi-level caches, memory and storage, cache coherence and consistency, and multi- and many-core
         processors.

         Prerequisites
         Undergraduate computer architecture course that covers basic computer organization; working knowledge of topics such as
         instruction sets, pipelining, etc. For the course project, you will also need to be familiar with C/C++, Linux, and be comfortable
         making modifications to large programs.

         If you answer “no” to any of the following questions, it may be beneficial to refresh you knowledge of the prerequisite
         material prior to taking CS 6290:

                Have you taken a computer organization course before?
                Are you familiar with at last one RISC instruction set and would you feel comfortable reading and writing small
                assembler programs?
                Are you familiar with basic computer architecture concepts, such as pipelines and caches?
                Are you familiar with C/C++ and would you be comfortable writing and/or modifying 100+ lines of code in a
                program that has over 100,000 lines of code?
                Are you comfortable with, or even excited about, learning about how real processors work and using simulation
                to see how changes in processor design affect its performance?
                Have you successfully completed the HPCA0 "course" at Udacity?


         Textbook
         There are no required readings. When appropriate, additional class materials will be available as instructor notes that are
         associated with the video lectures. Although we do not require and do not officially recommended a textbook, a useful
         textbook for this course is “Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach” by John L. Hennessy and David A.
         Patterson. A recent edition should work, but editions 1-4 put less emphasis on multi-core topics than our course does.


         Grading

         You will receive grades through T-Square. There are three types of grades:

                Projects – You will be given four projects, each requiring more work than the previous one. Each project is to be
                completed individually or in two-student teams, as specified in each project assignment.
                Exams – You will be given two exams – a midterm and a final exam.
                Udacity quizzes - You should complete all Udacity quizzes. Please note that you are not required to get the correct
                answer on these quizzes on the first try, but you do need to complete them all before you take the final exam.

         The projects and exams will count toward the final grade as follows:
                        Total Weight         Breakdown
         Projects       50%
                                             Project 0: 5%
                                             Project 1: 10%
                                             Project 2: 15%
                                             Project 3: 20%
         Exams          50%

,CS-6290-O01                                                                    https://t-square.gatech.edu/portal/tool/23e1c75a-147c-4059-affe-122ecb...



                                                 Midterm: 20%
                                                 Final Exam: 30%

         Note that completing Udacity quizzes does not contribute to your grade. You are expected to complete all quizzes within each
         lesson correctly regardless of the grade you expect. The only exception to this are problem sets (quizzes named "Problem 1",
         etc.) that appear at the end of most lessons - you are not required to complete all of those. For every non-problem-set quiz you do
         not complete, you will lose 1% of all the points you earned on projects and exams. E.g. a student who neglects to complete 10
         quizzes will lose 10% of the points earned on projects and exams.

         Also note that the Final Exam does include questions about material that was covered in the Midterm exam.

         The plan is to assign final (letter) grades based on your total score, with 90% and above earning an A, 80% and above earning a B,
         etc. If this results in too few As, we may decide to lower the thresholds somewhat, or to use some sort of a curve - the final
         decision whether and what to do in this regard is up to the instructor (Milos).

         There will be no make-up assignments, so if you need a particular grade plan to perform accordingly on projects and exams.
         Once a homework, project, or exam is over and graded, the only way the score on that assignment or exam will be changed is if a
         legitimate mistake in grading has been made. Due to the large number of students in this class, assignment and exam re-grades can
         only be requested during 14 days that follow the release of scores from that assignment/exam. When requesting a re-grade, keep
         in mind that the entire submitted project/exam will be regraded, so a request for a regrade may result in a loss of points.

         The grade in this class will be based solely on demonstrated performance. No grade will ever be changed because the student
         needs a better grade to stay in the program, to keep a fellowship, to get a job, or any other reason. If you believe you need some
         particular grade in this class, the only way to get that grade is to earn it on projects and exams.



         Emergencies and Late Policy
         No late assignments or exams will be accepted unless we advised to do so by the Dean of Students. Please contact
         the office of the Dean of Students with health emergencies, family emergencies, personal disabilities, or other significant
         events. The Dean’s office is equipped to verify these exceptions better than us, and provides a level of uniformity across
         courses on how emergencies are handled.


         Academic Integrity
         All Georgia Tech students are expected to uphold the Georgia Tech Honor Code. You should read it (including the Graduate
         Addendum)! We take cheating very seriously, that all Georgia Tech faculty (including the instructor for this course) are
         required to report cases of academic dishonesty to the Dean of Students’ office at Georgia Tech, and that cheating,
         unauthorized, collaboration, etc.


         Class Schedule
         This schedule lists important dates (exams, project release and due dates, etc.). The white-background items show the
         recommended schedule for completing lessons. Of course you can complete lessons at a faster pace, but projects and
         exams are timed assuming that you will take the lectures according to the provided schedule - so do not fall behind!
