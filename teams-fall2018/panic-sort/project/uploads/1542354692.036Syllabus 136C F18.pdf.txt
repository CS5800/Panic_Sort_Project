,REQUIRED TEXTBOOK and MATERIALS:
   1.   Intermediate Accounting, Kieso-Weygandt-Warfield, 16th Edition, Wiley, 2016 (available at the bookstore).
   2.   PowerPoint Slides (available on the textbook publisher web site, http://www.wiley.com/college/kieso).
   3.   Non-Programmable Calculator. The use of a programmable calculator on the exams will result in a loss of points.

SLIDES and HANDOUTS:
   Before each lecture, students should print the applicable PowerPoint slides. It will be helpful to follow the course
   lectures with the slides. The slides are available on the class GauchoSpace site and at
   http://www.wiley.com/college/kieso.


WILEYPLUS (WP) ASSIGNMENTS:
   Chapter homework must be completed and submitted using WileyPLUS.
   !    WileyPLUS is on online feature that allows access to the textbook electronically and allows the homework to be
        completed online. Each student will need a registration code to use WileyPLUS. The textbooks sold at the
        bookstore come with a registration code for WileyPLUS. If you obtain the textbook from a source other than the
        University Bookstore you will need to purchase the WileyPLUS registration code separately.
   !    You can purchase a code at http://www.wiley.com/college/buywileyplus/. If you purchase a WileyPLUS access
        code you will have access to the textbook online.
   !    Class Section URL: www.wileyplus.com/class/671944
   WileyPLUS times out after 20 minutes of inactivity. I encourage you to print out your assignments rather than lose
   any of your work. NOTE: Not all assignments may be due at the same time of day. Be sure to make note of the
   due date and time for each assignment. I recommend you complete the assignments well in advance of the due date
   to avoid unexpected circumstances like illness, work commitment, computer difficulties or the need to be out of town.
   Loss of points by not following the directions will not be corrected. Rounding errors will only be corrected for
   adjustments that exceed 1 point. If for any reason you miss the due date of an assignment you can complete it after the
   due date for half credit.

IF YOU HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY WITH REGISTRATION, please do NOT attempt to resolve via email to the
instructor. There are two means of resolving the problem that are far more effective:
   (1) The online chat with tech. support at the WileyPlus site is staffed by persons far more knowledgeable about the
       online software than the instructor and has proven to be very effective;
   (2) Come to office hours.
In order to register for WileyPLUS, you MUST HAVE PURCHASED AN ACCESS CODE (see links above for
purchasing separately if you did not purchase the textbook at bookstore).


   Grading: Within WileyPLUS you will be able to track your progress by reviewing your scores under the Gradebook
   link. The homework within WileyPLUS will be worth 15% or 150 points out of 1,000 points for the course. There will
   not be exactly 150 points allocated to the assignments within WileyPLUS, but your % of the total points on
   assignments will be converted to the same % of 150 points for that portion of your grade.


E-MAIL:
   In lieu of leaving me handwritten notes under my office door or in my box in the Econ office, I ask that you send any
   questions through email (jen.hulme@ucsb.edu). Please keep your questions sent by e-mail to an administrative
   nature. Technical questions related to class material should be asked in class or during office hours.

,EXAMS:
  The format of the exams may include true/false, multiple-choice, short-answer, exercise or problem type questions.
  The topics covered in lecture, the textbook, and the homework assignments should be your guide for topics tested on
  the exams. Use your textbook to reinforce topics covered in lecture. There are no practice exams available for study.
  For the exams you will need the following:
      •    Scantron (small green)
      •    Pencil for scantron. Pen for all other questions.
      •    Non-Programmable Calculator. PROGRAMMABLE CALCULATORS, CELL PHONES, or OTHER
           ELECTRONIC DEVICES ARE NOT ALLOWED DURING THE EXAMS. If you are found using any
           electronic device other than a NON-PROGRAMMABLE CALCULATOR it will be considered
           cheating and there will be a loss of points and possibly a zero score for the exam.
  Exams will not be returned in class, but you will have the opportunity to review the exam solution to confirm that your
  exam was scored correctly in office hours. The review must be completed before the next exam is taken. Regrades for
  less than 5 points will not be considered.
  Exams must be taken as scheduled on the syllabus. If you miss an exam, you can file for an incomplete and take the
  equivalent exam with the class the following quarter. You must inform the instructor by email prior to the scheduled
  exam date that will be missed. Incomplete petitions can be obtained from the Office of the Registrar.


GRADE POSTING:
  Periodically throughout the quarter the grade sheet will be posted on the class GauchoSpace site so each student can
  review their scores to determine they have been recorded accurately. For privacy reasons, the scores will be posted
  using a portion of each students perm number. If you prefer your scores not be posted in this fashion please let me
  know. For privacy reasons, scores will not be distributed via e-mail.


HONORS SECTION:
  There is not an Honors Section to accompany the course this quarter. If you would like to complete an Honors Contract
  instead, please email the instructor by the end of the first week of the quarter.


STUDENTS WITH TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT DISABILITIES:
  The Disabled Students Program (DSP) has the responsibility of coordinating academic support services for students
  with temporary or permanent disabilities. If you have a disability and would like to consider academic support for this
  class, you are responsible for ensuring that the Disabled Students Program (DSP) is aware of your disability and for
  providing DSP with appropriate documentation. The Disabled Students Program is located in the Student Resource
  Building (SRB). The SRB is located along the Pardall Road bike path, at the intersection of Ocean Road (along the
  UCSB/ Isla Vista border).


SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY:
  Instances of scholastic dishonesty will be handled in the most extreme fashion, as prescribed by University policy.
  Absolutely no cheating will be tolerated.


ATTENDANCE:
  Attendance will not be taken, however you are responsible for all that is said and done in lecture.


SHOULD YOU ENROLL?
  If the schedule for the exams and assignments conflicts with other activities you have planned, including UCSB team
  sports obligations, you should not take this course this quarter. By enrolling in this course you are accepting the class
  schedule and conditions as stated above.
